    "description": "<p>As part of the <a href=\"http://indico.ictp.it/event/8706/\">CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School in Trieste (5-16 Aug 2019)</a>, ELIXIR Training has contributed in the organization of the flanking Advanced Bioinformatics workshop (19-23 Aug 2019) with a particular focus on Machine Learning applications, as part of the ELIXIR Implementation Study on Learning Paths.</p>\n<p>This advanced bioinformatics course provided an overview of the current status of different NGS workflows (variant calling, RNA-Seq, etc), and combined them with the appropriate Machine Learning and Data Mining approaches. After providing a strong foundation of the underlying theory and concepts, the course relied heavily on hand-on exercises and tutorials in order for the participants to directly apply and practice on methods and techniques presented throughout each day.</p>\n<p>The material is organized into four days / modules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Experimental Design and Statistics</li>\n<li>Introduction to basic NGS pipelines</li>\n<li>Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics</li>\n<li>Introduction to Workflows and Nextflow</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All content has been designed to work with the <a href=\"https://readthedocs.org/\">readthedocs</a> platform, with the rendered site being available <a href=\"https://codata-rda-advanced-bioinformatics-2019.readthedocs.io\">here</a>.</p>",
